%p Do you have a discount code?
= form_for :discounts, method: :get do |f|
  = f.hidden_field current_store.id
  = f.label :name
  = f.text_field :name
  = f.submit "Apply"


/ check to see if input matches a discount code for that store
/ if there is a match, take the doscount.amount for that code and do math with the total price on cart.
